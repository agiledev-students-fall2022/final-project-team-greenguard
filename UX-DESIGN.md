# User Experience Design

## App Map
![App map](ux-design/appmap.png)

The App doesn't have a home page. It shows the map when you open the app.

There are 4 main branches in the app:
- Map: Users can view the locations of the items uploaded by other users.
- Add New Item: Users can upload post about the items they would like to give away.
- User Profile: Users can edit their profiles and view the posts they uploaded or saved.
- Messages: Users can send and receive text messages with other users.
